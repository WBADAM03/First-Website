<h1> Welcome to William Adams's Resume!</h1>
<!-- I did not use an unordered list because I did not want the entire resume (such as the titles of work places and degree programs) to be in a list and
     I did not wish to have a series of lists ending and starting.
     I found it easier, more efficent, and more appealing to have a P tag to encompass the entire resume and take advantage of the br take for line breaks
     Please let me know what would you do/advise in this situation - William Adams 1/16/2021 COMM 360-50 -->
